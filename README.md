# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction
IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project on Coursera

   Rocket launches are complex and costly endeavors, requiring meticulous planning and execution. Despite rigorous preparations, unforeseen challenges during launch can lead to mission failures, causing significant financial and operational setbacks.

   Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage.

   The objective of this project is to develop a predictive analysis model to determine the likelihood of success for the first stage of rocket launches, while also optimizing for cost savings. By analyzing past launch data and relevant factors, such as launch site, payload characteristics, weather conditions, and technical specifications, the model aims to identify patterns and correlations that influence mission outcomes. The ultimate goal is to provide insights and recommendations to optimize launch strategies and improve the likelihood of mission success.
